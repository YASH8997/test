                Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of fields including,
                computer engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency
                engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and electronics. Many of
                these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge 
                number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics
                , electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, 
                renewable energies, mechatronics, and electrical materials science. See glossary of electrical 
                and electronics engineering.<br>
                Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering or 
                electronic engineering. Practising engineers may have professional certification and
                be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These 
                include the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Institute of Electrical
                and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)
                (formerly the IEE). The IEC prepares international standards for electrical engineering,
                developed through consensus, thanks to the work of 20,000 electrotechnical experts, coming 
                from 172 countries worldwide.<br>
