                    <p class="p1">Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve 
                    hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball, golf, hockey,
                    tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.[2] In cricket's case, a key difference 
                    is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought,
                    a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend.[3] 
                    The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games:
                    the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); 
                    the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and 
                    the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from 
                    it".<br>

                    It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the
                    south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period.[3]
                    Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference 
                    to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on
                    Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar; equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian 
                    calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the
                    testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that<br>

                    Remember 2nd April, the World Cup victory and the plot?<br>
                    “Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into 
                    the crowd! India lift the World Cup after 28 years!”<br>
                    screamed Ravi Shastri on air. Dhoni just tweaked his elbow.<br>
                    What a fairytale end it was for the crowd to watch with that majestic
                     six from MS Dhoni. Dhoni held his pose as he watched the ball,
                     Yuvraj began to celebrate before the ball had even gone for six and 
                     the man they call Captain Cool had sealed his place in history.<br>
                      Sachin’s dream of lifting the world cup came true.<br>

                    And no prizes for guessing who the man was. On 19th September,
                    2007, India's Yuvraj Singh became the first-ever batsman to send
                    six balls over the boundary in a row for the first time in a T20I.
                    He hammered England's Stuart Broad to every corner of the ground in
                    the 19th over of the match.<br>
